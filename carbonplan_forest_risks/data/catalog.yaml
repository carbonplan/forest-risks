      title: Modeled biomass
      summary: Model results of biomass from historical and future climate simulations.
      description: |
        We developed a statistical model relating forest stand age to biomass, in order
        to project future biomass under assumptions of historical growth trends. The results
        exist for the historical period, as well as permutations of three future scenarios and
        12 global climate models.

      title: Modeled insect effect
      summary: Model results of insect effect.
      description: |
        Our analysis of insect-driven mortality was nearly identical to our analysis of drought.
        The first difference was that the dependent variable was fractional mortality multiplied
        by a condition-level estimate of the fraction of trees affected by insects, which is an
        assessment performed at the level of individual trees. The second difference is that,
        while fitting the hurdle model, we only included forest types with at least one positive
        exemplar. All other aspects of the input data and the model were the same.

      summary: Model results of drought effect.
      description: |
        We fit a statistical model predicting mortality as a function of climatic variables. Given
        the large prevalence of zeros in our mortality data, we modeled mortality using a “hurdle”
        model that jointly predicts the probability of a non-zero value and, if a non-zero value is
        present, its value (Cragg, 1971).

    metadata:
      title: Modeled biophysical effect
      summary: Model results of biophysical effect.
      description: |
        Biophysical effects from forests include an albedo effect (in which energy is reflected
        or absorbed) and a latent heat effect (in which the cooling effect of trees is modulated
        through evapotranspiration). In other words, trees can simultaneously warm the planet by
        absorbing radiation but also cool the planet via evaporating water — in addition to their
        role in the global carbon cycle. This net effect, which we label “biophysical”, depends on
        the forest type and the climate conditions. In most forests, this effect is net negative,
        with trees absorbing more energy than they emit. To estimate this variable we applied a
        biome-specific biophysical effect from Anderson-Teixeira et al (2012) to each of the mapped
        forest types from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). The resulting layer is a continuous
        map of biophysical effects due to forests. We then assume this variable to be constant
        throughout time.

      description: |
        We developed a statistical model relating the probability of very large fires to climatic
        variables. Our work is inspired by and builds on that of Barbero et al. (2014). Many of
        the methods are similar, though updated with more recent data (through 2018 rather than
        2010).

      description: |
        Data from climate models, like those included in CMIP6, frequently have significant biases
        that need to be corrected prior to use in impacts modeling studies like ours. These biases
        are due to both the models’ coarse spatial resolution and model errors. The downscaling and
        bias correction process is meant to correct the systemic biases in climate models, while
        preserving the underlying climate signals (e.g. warming or drying trends).
