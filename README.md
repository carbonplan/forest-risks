This repository includes our libraries and scripts for mapping forest carbon potential and risks.

## install

```shell
pip install carbonplan[forests]
```

## usage

This codebase is organized into modules that implement data loading and model fitting as well as utitlies for plotting and other common tasks. Most anlayses involve some combination of the `load` and `fit` modules.

There are four scripts in the `scripts` folder that use these tools to import data, run models, and parse results.

- `biomass.py`
- `fire.py`
- `drought.py`
- `insects.py`

And there are two additional scripts `regrid.py` and `convert.py` for converting the results to zarr files for storage and geojson for visualization purposes.

Several notebooks are additionally provided that show the use of these tools for fitting models and inspecting model outputs. Notebooks are organized by the model type, e.g. `biomass`, `fire`, etc.

## data products

As part of this project we have created derived data products for five key variables relevant to evaluating forest carbon storage potential and risks.
- `biomass` The potential carbon storage in forests assuming continued growth of existing forests.
- `drought` The projected future impacts of drought on forests.
- `fire` The risks associated with forest fires.
- `insects` The risk to forests from insect-related tree mortality.
- `biophysical` The climate impact of forests by reflecting/absorbing light and transpiration.

Gridded rasters for each of these layers are available for the continental United States at a 4km spatial scale from the 20th century through the end of the 21st century in decadal increments. All data are accessible via this [catalog](https://github.com/carbonplan/forests/blob/master/carbonplan_forests/data/catalog.yaml). Additional formats and download options will be provided in the future.
