      title: Modeled biomass
      summary: Model results of biomass from historical and future climate simulations.
      description: |
        We developed a statistical model relating forest stand age to biomass, in order
        to project future biomass under assumptions of historical growth trends. The results
        exist for the historical period as well as three future scenarios of the 21st century,
        each representing means of a six-member GCM ensemble.

      title: Modeled insect effect
      summary: Model results of insect effect.
      description: |
        We fit a statistical model predicting insect-driven mortality as a function of climatic variables.
        Given the large prevalence of zeros in our mortality data, we modeled mortality using a “hurdle”
        model that jointly predicts the probability of a non-zero value and, if a non-zero value is
        present, its value (Cragg, 1971). The results exist for the historical period. *Note: the results
        are a work in progress and we expect them to change.

      title: Modeled fire risk
      summary: Model results of fire risk from historical and future climate simulations.
      description: |
        We developed a statistical model relating the probability of very large fires to climatic
        variables. Our work is inspired by and builds on that of Barbero et al. (2014). Many of
        the methods are similar, though updated with more recent data (through 2018 rather than
        2010). The results exist for the historical period as well as three future scenarios of the
        21st century, each representing means of a six-member GCM ensemble.
